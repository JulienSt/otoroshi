# Monitoring services

Once you have declared services, you can monitor them with Otoroshi.

@@@ warning
You have to use [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) to enable analytics features in Otoroshi

Once you have setup @ref:[Otoroshi events push to an elastic cluster](../integrations/analytics.md) (through webhooks, kafka, or elastic integration) you can setup Otoroshi events read from an elastic cluster. Go to `settings (cog icon) / Danger Zone` and expand the `Analytics: Elastic cluster (write)` section.
