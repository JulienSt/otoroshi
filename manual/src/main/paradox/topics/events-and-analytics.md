# Events and analytics

Otoroshi is a solution fully traced : calls to services, access to UI, creation of resources, etc.

@@@ warning
You have to use [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co) to enable analytics features in Otoroshi

## Events

* Analytics event
* Gateway event
* TCP event
* Healthcheck event

## Event log

Otoroshi can read his own exported events from an Elasticsearch instance, set up in the danger zone. Theses events are available from the UI, at the following route: `https://xxxxx/bo/dashboard/events`.

The `Global events` page display all events of **GatewayEvent** type. This page is a way to quickly read an interval of events and can be used in addition of a Kibana instance.

For each event, a list of information will be displayed and an additional button `content` to watch the full content of the event, at the JSON format.

## Audit

With Otoroshi, any admin action and any sucpicious/alert action is recorded. These records are stored in Otoroshiâ€™s datastore (only the last n records, defined by the `otoroshi.events.maxSize` config key). All the records can be send through the analytics mechanism (WebHook, Kafka, Elastic) for external and/or further usage. We recommand sending away those records for security reasons.

Otoroshi keep the following list of information for each executed action:

* `Date`: moment of the action
* `User`: name of the owner
* `From`: IP of the concerned user
* `Action`: action performed by the person. The possible actions are:

    * `ACCESS_APIKEY`: User accessed a apikey

## Global metrics

The global metrics are displayed on the index page of the Otoroshi UI. Otoroshi provides information about :

* the number of requests served
* the amount of data received and sended
* the number of concurrent requests
* the number of requests per second
* the current overhead

More metrics can be found on the **Global analytics** page (available at https://xxxxxx/bo/dashboard/stats).

## Monitoring services

Once you have declared services, you can monitor them with Otoroshi. 

Let's starting by setup Otoroshi to push events to an elastic cluster via a data exporter. Then you will can setup Otoroshi events read from an elastic cluster. Go to `settings (cog icon) / Danger Zone` and expand the `Analytics: Elastic cluster (read)` section.

### Service healthcheck

If you have defined an health check URL in the service descriptor, you can access the health check page from the sidebar of the service page.

### Service live stats

You can also monitor live stats like total of served request, average response time, average overhead, etc. The live stats page can be accessed from the sidebar of the service page.

### Service analytics

You can also get some aggregated metrics. The analytics page can be accessed from the sidebar of the service page.
