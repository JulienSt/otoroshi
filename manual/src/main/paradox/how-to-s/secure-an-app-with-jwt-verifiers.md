# Secure an api with jwt verifiers

A Jwt verifier is the guard which check the signature of tokens present in incoming requests on a service. It can be a simple verifier, a tokens generator, or extend to be a verifier and a tokens generator.

### Before you start

@@include[initialize.md](../includes/initialize.md) { #initialize-otoroshi }

### Your first jwt verifier : a verifier of tokens

Let's start navigating the @link:[page of verifier creation](http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/bo/dashboard/jwt-verifiers/add) { open=new }. By default, the type of jwt verifier is a **Verify JWT token**.

Create the following verifier : 

* Set `simple-jwt-verifier` as `Name`
* Set `My simple jwt verifier` as `Description`
* We expect in entry a token in a specific header. Set `Authorization` as `Header name`
* Select `Hmac + SHA` as `Algo` (for this example, we expect tokens with a symetric signature)
* Set `otoroshi` as `Hmac secret`
* Remove the default field in `Verify token fields` array
* Create your verifier when clicking on `Create and stay on this Jwt verifier` button.

Once created, navigate to the simple service (created in @ref:[Before you start](#before-you-start) section) and jump to the `JWT tokens verification` section.

In the verifiers list, choose the `simple-jwt-verifier` and `enabled` the section.

Save your service and try to call the service.
```sh
curl -X GET 'http://myservice.oto.tools:8080/' --include
```

This should output : 
```json
{
    "Otoroshi-Error": "error.expected.token.not.found"
}
```

A simple way to generate a token is to use @link:[jwt.io](http://jwt.io) { open=new }. Once navigate, define `HS512` as `alg` in header section, and insert `otoroshi` as verify signature secret. 

Once created, copy-paste the token from jwt.io to the Authorization header and call our service.

```sh
# replace xxxx by the generated token
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: xxxx" \
  'http://myservice.oto.tools:8080'
```

This should output a json with `authorization` in headers field. Its value is exactly the same as the passed token.

```json
{
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/",
  "headers": {
    "host": "mirror.otoroshi.io",
    "authorization": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.ipDFgkww51mSaSg_199BMRj4gK20LGz_czozu3u8rCFFO1X20MwcabSqEzUc0q4qQ4rjTxjoR4HeUDVcw8BxoQ",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Verify and generate a new token

An other feature is to verify the entry token and generate a new token, with a different signature and news claims. 

Let's start by extending the @link:[previous verifier](http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/bo/dashboard/jwt-verifiers) { open=new }.

1. Jump to the `Verif Strategy` field and select `Verify and re-sign JWT token`. 
2. Edit the name with `jwt-verify-and-resign`
3. Remove the default field in `Verify token fields` array
4. Change the second `Hmac secret` in `Re-sign settings` section with `otoroshi-internal-secret`
5. Save your verifier.

> Note : the name of the verifier doesn't impact the identifier. So you can save the changes of your verifier without modifying the identifier used in your call.  

```sh
# replace xxxx by the generated token
curl -X GET \
  -H "Authorization: xxxx" \
  'http://myservice.oto.tools:8080'
```

This should output a json with `authorization` in headers field. This time, the value are different and you can check his signature on @link:[jwt.io](https://jwt.io) { open=new } (the expected secret of the generated token is **otoroshi-internal-secret**)

### Verify, transform and generate a new token

The most advanced verifier is able to do the same as the previous ones, with the ability to configure the token generation (claims, output header name).

Let's start by extending the @link:[previous verifier](http://otoroshi.oto.tools:8080/bo/dashboard/jwt-verifiers) { open=new }.

1. Jump to the `Verif Strategy` field and select `Verify, transform and re-sign JWT token`. 

2. Edit the name with `jwt-verify-transform-and-resign`
3. Remove the default field in `Verify token fields` array
4. Change the second `Hmac secret` in `Re-sign settings` section with `otoroshi-internal-secret`
5. Set `Internal-Authorization` as `Header name`
6. Set `key` on first field of `Rename token fields` and `from-otoroshi-verifier` on second field
7. Set `generated-key` and `generated-value` as `Set token fields`
8. Add `generated_at` and `${date}` as second field of `Set token fields` (Otoroshi supports an @ref:[expression language](../topics/expression-language.md))
9. Save your verifier and try to call your service again.

This should output a json with `authorization` in headers field and our generate token in `Internal-Authorization`.
Once paste in @link:[jwt.io](https://jwt.io) { open=new }, you should have :

You can see, in the payload of your token, the two claims **from-otoroshi-verifier** and **generated-key** added during the generation of the token by the JWT verifier.
