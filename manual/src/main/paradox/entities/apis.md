Otoroshi now introduces a new core entity: APIs. This feature marks a major step towards a more API Managementâ€“oriented experience by allowing users to manage their APIs as a whole, rather than configuring them route by route. With the API entity, you can define reusable backends, declare multiple plugin flows that can be applied across different paths, manage consumers and subscriptions, and track the state of an API throughout its lifecycle. This evolution unlocks powerful capabilities for building developer portals and brings Otoroshi closer to the expectations of a full-featured API Management platform.
