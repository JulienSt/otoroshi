You can found a concrete example @ref:[here](../how-to-s/secure-with-apikey.md)

* `ApiKey Id`: the id is a unique random key that will represent this API key
* `ApiKey Secret`: the secret is a random key used to validate the API key
* `ApiKey Name`: a name for the API key, used for debug purposes
* `ApiKey description`: a useful description for this apikey
* `Valid until`: auto disable apikey after this date
* `Enabled`: if the API key is disabled, then any call using this API key will fail
* `Read only`: if the API key is in read only mode, every request done with this api key will only work for GET, HEAD, OPTIONS verbs
* `Allow pass by clientid only`: here you allow client to only pass client id in a specific header in order to grant access to the underlying api
* `Constrained services only`: this apikey can only be used on services using apikey routing constraints
* `Authorized on`: the groups/services linked to this api key

### Metadata and tags

* `Tags`: tags attached to the api key
* `Metadata`:Â metadata attached to the api key

### Automatic secret rotation

API can handle automatic secret rotation by themselves. When enabled, the rotation changes the secret every `Rotation every` duration. During the `Grace period` both secret will be usable.
 
* `Enabled`: enabled automatic apikey secret rotation
* `Rotation every`: rotate secrets every
* `Grace period`: period when both secrets can be used
* `Next client secret`: display the next generated client secret

### Restrictions

* `Enabled`: enable restrictions
* `Allow last`: Otoroshi will test forbidden and notFound paths before testing allowed paths
* `Allowed`: allowed paths
* `Forbidden`: forbidden paths
* `Not Found`: not found paths

### Call examples

* `Curl Command`: simple request with the api key passed by header
* `Basic Auth. Header`: authorization Header with the api key as base64 encoded format
* `Curl Command with Basic Auth. Header`: simple request with api key passed in the Authorization header as base64 format

### Quotas

* `Throttling quota`: the authorized number of calls per second
* `Daily quota`: the authorized number of calls per day
* `Monthly quota`: the authorized number of calls per month

@@@ warning

Daily and monthly quotas are based on the following rules :

* daily quota is computed between 00h00:00.000 and 23h59:59.999 of the current day
* monthly qutoas is computed between the first day of the month at 00h00:00.000 and the last day of the month at 23h59:59.999
@@@

### Quotas consumption

* `Consumed daily calls`: the number of calls consumed today
* `Remaining daily calls`: the remaining number of calls for today
* `Consumed monthly calls`: the number of calls consumed this month
* `Remaining monthly calls`: the remaining number of calls for this month
