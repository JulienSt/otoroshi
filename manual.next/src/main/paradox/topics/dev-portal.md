# Developer portal with Daikoku

While Otoroshi is the perfect tool to manage your webapps in a technical point of view it lacked of business perspective. This is not the case anymore whith Daikoku.

While Otoroshi is a standalone, Daikoku is a developer portal which stands in front of Otoroshi and provides some business feature.

Whether you want to use Daikoku for your public APIs you want to monetize or with your private APIs to provide some documentation, facilitation and self-service feature, it will be the perfect portal for Otoroshi.
