# Service descriptors

Services or service descriptor, let you declare how to proxy a call from a domain name to another domain name (or multiple domain names).

@@@

Letâ€™s say you have an API exposed on http://192.168.0.42 and I want to expose it on https://my.api.foo. Otoroshi will proxy all calls to https://my.api.foo and forward them to http://192.168.0.42. While doing that, it will also log everyhting, control accesses, etc.


* `Id`: a unique random string to identify your service
* `Groups`: each service descriptor is attached to a group. A group can have one or more services. Each API key is linked to a group and allow access to every service in the group.
* `Create a new group`: you can create a new group to host this descriptor
* `Create dedicated group`: you can create a new group with an auto generated name to host this descriptor
* `Name`: the name of your service. Only for debug and human readability purposes.
* `Description`: the description of your service. Only for debug and human readability purposes.
* `Service enabled`: activate or deactivate your service. Once disabled, users will get an error page saying the service does not exist.
* `Read only mode`: authorize only GET, HEAD, OPTIONS calls on this service
* `Maintenance mode`: display a maintainance page when a user try to use the service
* `Construction mode`: display a construction page when a user try to use the service
* `Log analytics`: Log analytics events for this service on the servers
* `Use new http client`: will use Akka Http Client for every request
* `Detect apikey asap`: If the service is public and you provide an apikey, otoroshi will detect it and validate it. Of course this setting may impact performances because of useless apikey lookups.
* `Send Otoroshi headers back`: when enabled, Otoroshi will send headers to consumer like request id, client latency, overhead, etc ...
* `Override Host header`: when enabled, Otoroshi will automatically set the Host header to corresponding target host
* `Send X-Forwarded-* headers`: when enabled, Otoroshi will send X-Forwarded-* headers to target
* `Force HTTPS`: will force redirection to https:// if not present
* `Allow HTTP/1.0 requests`: will return an error on HTTP/1.0 request
* `Use new WebSocket client`: will use the new websocket client for every websocket request
* `TCP/UDP tunneling`: with this setting enabled, otoroshi will not proxy http requests anymore but instead will create a secured tunnel between a cli on your machine and otoroshi to proxy any tcp connection with all otoroshi security features enabled

### Service exposition settings

* `Exposed domain`: the domain used to expose your service. Should follow pattern: (http|https)://subdomain?.env?.domain.tld?/root? or regex (http|https):\/\/(.*?)\.?(.*?)\.?(.*?)\.?(.*)\/?(.*)
* `Legacy domain`: use 'domain', 'subdomain', 'env' and 'matchingRoot' for routing in addition to hosts, or just use hosts.
* `Strip path`: when matching, strip the matching prefix from the upstream request URL. Defaults to true
* `Issue Let's Encrypt cert.`: automatically issue and renew let's encrypt certificate based on domain name. Only if Let's Encrypt enabled in global config.
* `Issue certificate`: automatically issue and renew a certificate based on domain name
* `Possible hostnames`: all the possible hostnames for your service
* `Possible matching paths`: all the possible matching paths for your service

### Redirection

* `Redirection enabled`: enabled the redirection. If enabled, a call to that service will redirect to the chosen URL
* `Http redirection code`: type of redirection used
* `Redirect to`: URL used to redirect user when the service is called

### Service targets

* `Redirect to local`: if you work locally with Otoroshi, you may want to use that feature to redirect one specific service to a local host. For example, you can relocate https://foo.preprod.bar.com to http://localhost:8080 to make some tests
* `Load balancing`: the load balancing algorithm used
* `Targets`: the list of target that Otoroshi will proxy and expose through the subdomain defined before. Otoroshi will do round-robin load balancing between all those targets with circuit breaker mecanism to avoid cascading failures
* `Targets root`: Otoroshi will append this root to any target choosen. If the specified root is '/api/foo', then a request to https://yyyyyyy/bar will actually hit https://xxxxxxxxx/api/foo/bar

### URL Patterns

* `Make service a 'public ui'`: add a default pattern as public routes
* `Make service a 'private api'`: add a default pattern as private routes
* `Public patterns`: by default, every services are private only and you'll need an API key to access it. However, if you want to expose a public UI, you can define one or more public patterns (regex) to allow access to anybody. For example if you want to allow anybody on any URL, just use '/.*'
* `Private patterns`: if you define a public pattern that is a little bit too much, you can make some of public URL private again

### Restrictions

* `Enabled`: enable restrictions
* `Allow last`: Otoroshi will test forbidden and notFound paths before testing allowed paths
* `Allowed`: allowed paths
* `Forbidden`: forbidden paths
* `Not Found`: not found paths

### Otoroshi exchange protocol

* `Enabled`: when enabled, Otoroshi will try to exchange headers with downstream service to ensure no one else can use the service from outside.
* `Send challenge`: when disbaled, Otoroshi will not check if target service respond with sent random value.
* `Send info. token`: when enabled, Otoroshi add an additional header containing current call informations
* `Challenge token version`: version the otoroshi exchange protocol challenge. This option will be set to V2 in a near future.
* `Info. token version`: version the otoroshi exchange protocol info token. This option will be set to Latest in a near future.
* `Tokens TTL`: the number of seconds for tokens (state and info) lifes
* `State token header name`: the name of the header containing the state token. If not specified, the value will be taken from the configuration (otoroshi.headers.comm.state)
* `State token response header name`: the name of the header containing the state response token. If not specified, the value will be taken from the configuration (otoroshi.headers.comm.stateresp)
* `Info token header name`: the name of the header containing the info token. If not specified, the value will be taken from the configuration (otoroshi.headers.comm.claim)
* `Excluded patterns`: by default, when security is enabled, everything is secured. But sometimes you need to exlude something, so just add regex to matching path you want to exlude.
* `Use same algo.`: when enabled, all JWT token in this section will use the same signing algorithm. If `use same algo.` is disabled, three more options will be displayed to select an algorithm for each step of the calls :
    * Otoroshi to backend
    * Backend to otoroshi
    * Info. token

* `Algo.`: What kind of algorithm you want to use to verify/sign your JWT token with
* `SHA Size`: Word size for the SHA-2 hash function used
* `Hmac secret`: used to verify the token
* `Base64 encoded secret`: if enabled, the extracted token will be base64 decoded before it is verifier

### Authentication

* `Enforce user authentication`: when enabled, user will be allowed to use the service (UI) only if they are registered users of the chosen authentication module.
* `Auth. config`: authentication module used to protect the service
* `Create a new auth config.`: navigate to the creation of authentication module page
* `all auth config.`: navigate to the authentication pages

* `Excluded patterns`: by default, when security is enabled, everything is secured. But sometimes you need to exlude something, so just add regex to matching path you want to exlude.
* `Strict mode`: strict mode enabled

### Api keys constraints

* `From basic auth.`: you can pass the api key in Authorization header (ie. from 'Authorization: Basic xxx' header)
* `Allow client id only usage`: you can pass the api key using client id only (ie. from Otoroshi-Token header)
* `From custom headers`: you can pass the api key using custom headers (ie. Otoroshi-Client-Id and Otoroshi-Client-Secret headers)

### JWT tokens verification

This part has been deprecated and moved to the plugin section.

### Gzip support

* `Mimetypes allowed list`: gzip only the files that are matching to a format in the list

* `Excluded patterns`: by default, when gzip is enabled, everything has gzip. But sometimes you need to exlude something, so just add regex to matching path you want to exlude.
